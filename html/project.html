What I really wanted to do with this site was create a centralized place to put my projects out in the open so that people could see what I've been up to. My hope was that by pushing to make things more public I'd create the opportunity for more of a discussion around the projects I've worked on and create an opportunity for people to offer feedback on what I've been up to. However, on top of that I also really wanted to create a project notebook of sorts which would track my development progress and give a more intimate look into what my thought process and general thinking was along the way. The hope there was that by documenting the journey I'd create something more interesting for people to follow and perhaps get tips on how to better approach things in the future. If nothing else, it would also serve as a history for myself so that when I eventually get stuck while working on something new I have a place to look back to in the hopes of pulling lessons out of my past self. The road to create this project wasn't a smooth one, even though the end result was something so simple. The reason for that was the weird winding path I took to get to where this site is today.", "", ""),

I later went on to find that there a number of other terms for the same idea, but c'est la vie. So the design philosophy I wanted to stress test with this site to see if it should be my standard for developing other sites was a combination of making it explicit what I wanted and then trying to find the simplest ways of accomplishing that. The general thinking behind this being that simple it doesn't matter how much you try and polish a turd it will still be a turd so you might as well put all that energy into making sure the thing you build off of is something of value, and that when you let simple things interact you can get beautiful complexity. Along with this, I also believed that combining simple tools to create complex actions makes it so that you can do really interesting things that a user can still understand (if they understand the simple components, there's a logic about how those components should act with one another).", "", ""),
